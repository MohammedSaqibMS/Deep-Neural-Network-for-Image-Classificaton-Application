# 🧠 Deep Neural Network for Image Classification: Application

Welcome to the **Deep Neural Network for Image Classification** repository! This project implements a multi-layer neural network to classify images (e.g., cats vs. non-cats) using Python. 🐱📸

Special thanks to [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/) for their fantastic **Deep Learning Specialization** course, which inspired this project! 💡
